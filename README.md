### Add Gun
-------------

"People keep telling me to 'Add Gun'. So fine, I'm adding it." -ProgrammerDan

AddGun is a standalone plugin allow you to use an vanilla item as a gun featuring magazine, bullet, repair, loading, aiming, and custom damage! AddGun was made for a Civ server called Devoted which it never carry over to another Civ server since then. I (KingColton1) decided to fork ProgrammerDan's AddGun to continue the project and turn from being "Civ-only plugin" to a standalone, independent plugin where you can use them in any Minecraft servers without needing another plugin to make this work!

Concerning the CombatTag, I plan to have this plugin be flexible with all kind of CombatTag plugins by either; provide ID numbers of items that are used for this plugin or whatsoever. I'll figure out with this later.

v INSTRUCTION / MANUAL v

## The Basics
--------------

If you enable them in config, players can get guns using the following simple commands:

**/gun** -- presents a menu with all configured guns

**/magazine** -- some guns aren't loaded directly, but via "magazines" of bullets, this command brings up a menu to pick 'em

**/bullet** -- guns need bullets to fire, brings up a menu showing all configured bullets.

### Loading
-----------

To load bullets into guns or magazines, pick up the bullets. While holding them, right click the magazine, or gun, as indicated.

Pay attention to the lore on the gun / magazine -- it'll tell you if it can hold the bullets you've picked up or not.

To load magazines into guns, pick up the magazine, and right click the gun. If a magazine is already loaded, it will be swapped out with the one you are holding.

If you've "locked" a magazine to a particular bullet type, but the magazine is now empty, right click the magazine with nothing in your hand, to "free it" for other
kinds of bullets.

### Repair
---------

Guns wear out, and will begin to misfire more often (potentially explosively!) as they are used. If enabled, type **/rgun** while holding the gun, to
fully repair it.

### Misfire
-----------

Some guns wear out quickly, others won't -- this depends on their health, and the "curve" settings for misfire chances (inflection and smoothness).

Pay attention to the gun, there will be a message in the lore indicating if the gun is wearing out. Some guns are just unreliable, and will come out
of the factory with some "wear" visible.

### Aiming
----------

Note: this section subject to change.

To aim any gun, a combination of stillness and crouching is necessary. This is to emulate " lining up your shot " in real life. If you don't take the
time to line up your shot, you'll likely miss your target -- often by a lot. Some guns have a nasty kick to them. Others are generally easily aimed. Again,
this is all controlled by configuration... In any case, crouch, to see a visual indicator of the quality of your aim. Wait for it to go green before shooting,
for best results.

### Damage
----------

All damage is fully custom and configurable. I'll explain more about that later.
